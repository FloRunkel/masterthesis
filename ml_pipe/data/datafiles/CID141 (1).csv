I advise clients together with our implementation experts and account managers on how to successfully find their way through the current jungle of buzzwords like industry 4.0, iIoT, MES, MOM, ... Like that customers can step-by-step find the right way in the I4.0 age. Every customer has an individual situation with existing systems and often a diverse portfolio of manufacturing sites. All of that needs to be properly analyzed before making a final decision on a solution. We believe that a one-size-fits-all approach does not match real industry needs. On the other hand we have a comprehensive and configurable standard set of functions in HYDRA to get you up to speed soon after system install. We serve multiple verticals like Metals, Plastic, Automotive, Building materials, Packaging since our solution HYDRA is not focussing on solely one industry. The company MPDV and the MES HYDRA is a veteran in the field of manufacturing software since we are dealing with this since 40 years in over 50 countries. I love it, because it is still a family owned business, but with a global footprint. Thus we can act fast and flexible to our clients' requirements compared to big software enterprises.
