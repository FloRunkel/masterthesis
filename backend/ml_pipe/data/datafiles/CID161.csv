For all the things you want to get. For all the ways you want to earn. Across the entire world. In real time. At the incredible speed of now.\n\nThe idea for Uber was born on a snowy night in Paris in 2008, and ever since then our DNA of reimagination and reinvention carries on. We’ve grown into a global platform powering flexible earnings and the movement of people and things in ever expanding ways. We’ve gone from connecting rides on 4 wheels to 2 wheels to 18-wheel freight deliveries. From takeout meals to daily essentials to prescription drugs to just about anything you need at any time and earning your way. From drivers with background checks to real-time verification, safety is a top priority every single day.

Our end-to-end analytics platform includes the capabilities needed to discover, organize, consume, and share data with industry-leading price-performance for cloud and on-premises workloads. We believe the lakehouse should be the center of gravity, but support accessing data outside the lake when needed. With Starburst, teams can access more complete data, run scalable analytics, lower the cost of infrastructure, use tools best suited to their needs, and avoid vendor lock-in. Trusted by companies like Apache Corporation, Comcast, Doordash, DBS Bank, and VMware, Starburst helps you make better decisions faster on all data.\n\nJoin us! -- Our company was founded in an unusual way; with customers and revenue from the beginning! Our growth is already ahead of some of the most successful software start-ups, and we don’t plan on slowing down.\n\nWe believe our opportunity is huge. Every large company in the world suffers from a data silo problem. Traditional data warehouse products approach the problem with old solutions that breed inefficiency and ultimately can’t help business analysts run fast analytics on all their data. This prevents the business from making better decisions to improve their company’s performance. Starburst provides a modern solution that addresses these data silo & speed of access problems. Starburst helps enterprises harness the value of Trino, the fastest distributed query engine available today, by adding the tools and 24x7 support that meet the needs for big data access at scale. Ultimately, Starburst helps organizations run analytics anywhere to make better business decisions.\n\nWe’re building a team of all-stars: engineers, customer success, sales, and marketing pros who are at the top of their game.

It runs through our veins. It’s what gets us out of bed each morning. It pushes us to constantly reimagine how we can move better. For you. For all the places you want to go. For all the things you want to get. For all the ways you want to earn. Across the entire world. In real time. At the incredible speed of now.\n\nThe idea for Uber was born on a snowy night in Paris in 2008, and ever since then our DNA of reimagination and reinvention carries on. We’ve grown into a global platform powering flexible earnings and the movement of people and things in ever expanding ways. We’ve gone from connecting rides on 4 wheels to 2 wheels to 18-wheel freight deliveries. From takeout meals to daily essentials to prescription drugs to just about anything you need at any time and earning your way. From drivers with background checks to real-time verification, safety is a top priority every single day.

Doing that we reduce global carbon emissions and generate millions in profits for our clients.\n\nToday, more than 40% of all food produced globally is wasted. Food waste produces carbon emissions 6x higher than the entire aviation industry and if it were a country, it would be the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, right behind China and the US. Besides that, it also causes $1.2 trillion/year in losses.\n\nGrocery retailers throw away up to 15% of their fresh products due to poor ordering decisions. Order quantities are most often based on gut feeling or, at best, spreadsheets or traditional forecasting and replenishment software. Juggling the hundreds of factors a good order is based on is hard.\n\nWe’re already working with the largest grocery retailers in Germany and France, where we are already reducing food waste by 25% while increasing their revenue! We’ve secured significant funding from Europe’s leading investors and several highly relevant angel investors in the food space.

I can see myself working for a company like Glassnode/Relai/Tether in the near future. Both selling & coding.
