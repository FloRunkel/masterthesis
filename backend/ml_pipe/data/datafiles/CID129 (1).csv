Businesses no longer need to plan and procure servers and other IT resources weeks or months in advance. Using AWS, businesses can take advantage of Amazon's expertise and economies of scale to access resources when their business needs them, delivering results faster and at a lower cost.\r\n\r\nToday, Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world.

The ultimate benefit of cloud computing, and AWS, is the ability to leverage a new business model and turn capital infrastructure expenses into variable costs. Businesses no longer need to plan and procure servers and other IT resources weeks or months in advance. Using AWS, businesses can take advantage of Amazon's expertise and economies of scale to access resources when their business needs them, delivering results faster and at a lower cost.\r\n\r\nToday, Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world. With data center locations in the U.S., Europe, Singapore, and Japan, customers across all industries are taking advantage of our low cost, elastic, open and flexible, secure platform."",""logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQE0fp2sCqnVLg/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1738855736997/amazon_web_services_logo?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=w-ljXN7M_zBCuPMi9pMGEB87djwKOSTjMKzcXWMRgjA"",""industry"":[""IT Services and IT Consulting""],""id"":""2382910""},""description"":"""",""company"":""Amazon Web Services (AWS)"",""location"":""On-site"",""position"":""Startup Account Manager"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/02/2024""},{""duration"":""01/07/2022 - 01/01/2024"",""endDate"":""01/01/2024"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":"""",""company"":""Amazon Web Services (AWS)"",""location"":""On-site"",""position"":""Startup Account Executive"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/07/2022""},{""duration"":""01/03/2022 - 01/06/2022"",""endDate"":""01/06/2022"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":"""",""company"":""Amazon Web Services (AWS)"",""location"":""On-site"",""position"":""Digital Native Business Development Representative"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/03/2022""},{""duration"":""01/03/2021 - 01/03/2022"",""endDate"":""01/03/2022"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":"""",""company"":""Amazon Web Services (AWS)"",""location"":""On-site"",""position"":""Digital Native Business Development Graduate"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/03/2021""},{""duration"":""01/05/2018 - 01/04/2023"",""endDate"":""01/04/2023"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":"""",""company"":""BAGSOLATE GmbH"",""location"":""Greater Munich Metropolitan Area"",""position"":""Co-Founder"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/05/2018""},{""duration"":""01/07/2019 - 01/07/2022"",""endDate"":""01/07/2022"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":"""",""company"":""LABELBIRD"",""location"":""Munich, Bavaria, Germany"",""position"":""Co-Founder | Business Development & Label Success"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/07/2019""},{""duration"":""01/11/2018 - 01/03/2021"",""endDate"":""01/03/2021"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":"""",""company"":""intouchCONSULT e.V."",""location"":""Regensburg und Umgebung, Deutschland"",""position"":""Consultant"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/11/2018""},{""duration"":""01/08/2020 - 01/10/2020"",""endDate"":""01/10/2020"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":""• conceptualizing a DACH Partner Finder Tool for the Amazon Partner Network with global scale"",""company"":""Amazon Web Services (AWS)"",""location"":""Munich, Bavaria, Germany"",""position"":""Business Development Intern"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/08/2020""},{""duration"":""01/05/2020 - 01/07/2020"",""endDate"":""01/07/2020"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":""• research for sensor technology, energy harvesting and blockchain in the beverage industry"",""company"":""Krones AG"",""location"":""Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany"",""position"":""Innovation Lab Werkstudent"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/05/2020""},{""duration"":""01/02/2020 - 01/04/2020"",""endDate"":""01/04/2020"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":""The network of the German chambers of foreign trade is the most important partner abroad for the promotion of foreign trade on behalf of Germany.\nThrough the AHK service brand DEinternational, companies worldwide receive professional advice and support to successfully build and expand their overseas business operations.

Companies that have been selling door closers for decades have transformed into suppliers of entry solutions, modular construction firms are replacing on-site installers, and more and more players from Asia or companies like Amazon are pushing into the European construction market. Therefore traditional sales methods alone are not enough\n\nThrough our work with hundreds of companies in this space, we have built a Revenue Engineering solution. Combining AI data insights, process excellence and talent development, Building Radar uncovers your untapped revenue potential and helps you to capture it by building a scalable and measurable sales pipeline.\n\nDon’t just rely on your great solutions. Empower your sales teams to win the most lucrative and profitable projects. We have already helped businesses like Schüco, Viessmann or Siemens close over €2B in untapped revenue.

Dafür bieten wir eine webbasierte Plattform für Versicherungsvertriebe mit integrierten Funktionen für Vergleich, Beratung und Verwaltung von Versicherungs- und Vorsorgeprodukten bzw. -verträgen. Das System verbindet zudem die Prozesse und Datenflüsse der Vertriebe direkt mit den Versicherungsunternehmen. So schaffen wir eine zukunftsfähige und vollständig digitalisierte Lösung für die gesamte Versicherungsbranche. Die offene Architektur ermöglicht dabei Raum für Individualität.\n\nUnsere Plattform und Produkte:\n•\tSMART INSUR: In webbasierter Plattform integrierte Verwaltungs- und Beratungs-Lösung\n•\tSMART ADMIN: Flexible Fachmodule für Vertrags-, Partner- und Schadenverwaltung und Rechnungswesen\n•\tSMART CONSULT: Unterstützt anlassbezogene und Konzeptberatung\n•\tSMART COMPARE: Webbasierte Vergleichsrechner, inkl. B2C-Variante\n\nZiel\n\nWir sehen Digitalisierung als Chance. Die hoch automatisierten Prozesse der Plattform schaffen Effizienz und Transparenz und führen so zu deutlichen Kostenvorteilen und damit nachhaltigem Geschäftserfolg von Versicherungsunternehmen und Vertrieben. Zugleich werden die Kundenerwartungen an Digitalisierung erfüllt. Durch die standardisierte Vernetzung der Marktteilnehmer schaffen wir die Möglichkeit, Versicherungsprodukte dauerhaft kostengünstiger anzubieten, verkaufen und verwalten zu können.\n\nBasis\n\nDie Smart InsurTech AG ist eine 100%ige Tochter der Hypoport SE, die mit der Plattform EUROPACE das führende deutsche System zur digitalen Kreditvermittlung geschaffen hat.
