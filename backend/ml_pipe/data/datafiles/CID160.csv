STAYERY combines the comfort of an apartment with the service of a hotel. With us you can do everything you do at home and even more: STAYERY means to be part of the city. To know where the best drinks are. Real neighbours instead of just next door, stylishly designed apartments and many extras. Short but sweet: who visits us, stays longer.\n\nOUR STORY\nWe are the start-up amongst the Serviced Apartments. Our first STAYERY opened 2019 in Berlin Friedrichshain, followed by Bielefeld later that year. Our objective is a longstay concept, which for a change is not boring and anonymous. Apartments with a focus on design and functionality. All larger than a hotel room, of course. With a cosy bed niche, pantry kitchen, rain shower and our unique living chaise. Oh yes. Of course there would also be our Loft, something like a Lobby only in cool. It offers everything business travellers and globetrotters could wish for.\n\nBut that's not it yet. Our STAYERY family will grow as we will open in Frankfurt, Cologne, Dresden and many more. Because only one STAYERY is not enough for us. We think very, very big!\n\nWORKING AT STAYERY\nWe loosen up the dusty hotel business and leave shirt and tie in the closet. For that we offer t-shirts and sneakers. We communicate digitally. Start-up atmosphere! And that's exactly why the founders Robert and Hannibal are never far away. Remember: Our business is people first. And that also means employees first!

The go-getters. The kind of people who are relentless about our mission to help people go anywhere and get anything and earn their way. Movement is what we power. It’s our lifeblood. It runs through our veins. It’s what gets us out of bed each morning. It pushes us to constantly reimagine how we can move better. For you. For all the places you want to go. For all the things you want to get. For all the ways you want to earn. Across the entire world. In real time. At the incredible speed of now.\n\nThe idea for Uber was born on a snowy night in Paris in 2008, and ever since then our DNA of reimagination and reinvention carries on. We’ve grown into a global platform powering flexible earnings and the movement of people and things in ever expanding ways. We’ve gone from connecting rides on 4 wheels to 2 wheels to 18-wheel freight deliveries. From takeout meals to daily essentials to prescription drugs to just about anything you need at any time and earning your way. From drivers with background checks to real-time verification, safety is a top priority every single day. At Uber, the pursuit of reimagination is never finished, never stops, and is always just beginning."",""logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQFiYnR1Mbtxdg/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1630552741617/uber_com_logo?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=vBNyuY1Hv4oHiyDgAW1EGZ0vq2CieiNDSyj1RDcfMfA"",""industry"":[""Internet Marketplace Platforms""],""id"":""1815218""},""description"":""Sales Representative Uber Eats\n\n• Cold Callings\n• Leadgenerierung\n• Gebietsexpansion\n• Vertragsabschluss\n• Onboarding\n• Stammdatenpflege \n• Partnerschaftspflege\n• Umsatzgenerierung \n• Einhaltung vorgeschriebener Ziele "",""company"":""Uber"",""location"":""Berlin, Deutschland"",""position"":""Sales"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/07/2023""},{""duration"":""01/11/2022 - 01/07/2023"",""endDate"":""01/07/2023"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":""• Stammdatenpflege\n• interne Projektarbeit \n• Einpflegen neuer Produkte im System \n• Prozessoptimierung \n"",""company"":""DefShop GmbH"",""location"":""Berlin, Deutschland"",""position"":""Buying | Operations"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/11/2022""},{""duration"":""01/07/2022 - 01/10/2022"",""endDate"":""01/10/2022"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":""• Kommunikation zu externen Stakeholder \n• Bestellung neuer Produkte \n• Kalkulation von Produktmengen "",""company"":""everphone"",""location"":""Berlin, Deutschland"",""position"":""Sourcing"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/07/2022""},{""duration"":""01/07/2021 - 01/06/2022"",""endDate"":""01/06/2022"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":""• Neuheiten im System anlegen\n• Mengenkalkulation \n• Preisgewichtungen kalkulieren \n• Kommunikation mit externen Stakeholdern\n• Stammdatenpflege "",""company"":""flaconi"",""location"":"""",""position"":""Buying"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/07/2021""}],""location"":""Germany"",""certifications"":[],""headline"":""Uber | Uber Eats"",""languageSkills"":{}}",connectionRequestRevoked,,2025-02-27T07:24:38.886Z lm

More than 60,000 lessons in 15 languages are hand-crafted by more than 200 linguists, and user behaviour is constantly analysed to shape and improve the learner experience. \n\nThe Babbel team is as diverse as our content. Based in Berlin, Germany, and New York, USA, 1,000+ Babbelonians from over 80 nationalities represent the diverse backgrounds, characteristics, and perspectives that make each person unique. Building genuine connections with our users is what sets Babbel apart, making it the world's leading language-learning platform with more than 16 million subscriptions sold.\n\nFounded in 2007 as the pioneering online language learning platform, we've grown steadily over the years.

Mobius Labs are going a step further: it’s no longer just Computer Vision, it’s Superhuman Vision. \nSuperhuman Vision means instantly transforming thousands of images and videos into insight, experience, and advantage. Our artificial intelligence-powered technology supercharges visual searches by understanding everything about an image or a video, and automatically creating descriptive metadata for the same.\nThe SDK can run on cloud, local servers and edge devices (like laptops and smartphones) providing the ability to instantly understand and analyze images, video footage, and real-life scenarios. Fast, customizable and trainable with very little data, Mobius Labs' AI transforms image and video archives and makes search and tagging problems a thing of the past.\nWe believe that Vision is a power. Our goal is to add Superhuman Vision to any application, device or process, thus giving you unassailable competitive advantage.\nTo get in touch, drop us an email at marketing@mobiuslabs.com or visit our website. \n\n\nMobius Labs GmbH is receiving additional funding by the ProFIT program of the Investment Bank of Berlin. The goal of the ProFIT project “Superhuman Vision 2.0 for every application - no code, customizable, on-premise  AI solutions ” is to revolutionize the work with technical images.

Each day, GLS delivers millions of parcels through its seamless cross-border network.

With a sharp eye on what matters most - the customer - GLS has a presence in almost all European countries and operates through wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada and on the USA’s West Coast, all within one GLS network. The GLS network consists of 88 central and regional transhipment points and about 1,600 depots, which are supported by approximately 35,000 final-mile delivery vehicles and 4,600 long-distance trucks. The way GLS actively manages its network and connects its markets gives the company the agility and flexibility to respond to fast-changing conditions in the industry. In 2020/21, GLS generated record revenues of 4.5 billion euros and delivered 840 million parcels, despite global challenges.\n\nWith approximately 19,000 employees, we form a global network that contributes significantly to our success. Complex logistics processes lie between the click on \""order\"" and the delivery of goods. Even more important - but not always visible at first glance - are jobs and people behind the scenes. Employees who work together and make the flow of parcels possible in the first place.

At 7Learnings we create an environment where constant learning is encouraged. We create a winning team by teaching and helping each other to gain new skills. We believe learning does not happen automatically: You have to put in the work to keep on growing.\n\nWe believe in a culture based on transparency and honesty. We call it what it is and don’t beat around the bush. We offer candor feedback to our colleagues and don’t gossip behind their backs. We are honest about our mistakes and face the facts. \n\nWe own it. We are not victims but actively shape the way we work. We take pride in our work and aspire to achieve the best results possible.

At the same time, it will provide a high-fidelity environment for professionals to visualize and simulate ocean-related scenarios and to communicate their work.

For all the things you want to get. For all the ways you want to earn. Across the entire world. In real time. At the incredible speed of now.\n\nThe idea for Uber was born on a snowy night in Paris in 2008, and ever since then our DNA of reimagination and reinvention carries on.

From takeout meals to daily essentials to prescription drugs to just about anything you need at any time and earning your way.

Doch bevor es mit der Ausbildungssuche losgeht, steht vor allem die berufliche Orientierung im Fokus. Denn wir wissen, dass 81 %* der Schüler:innen Schwierigkeiten haben, sich beruflich zu orientieren. Deshalb sorgt unser KI-gestützter Ausbildungsberater dafür, dass Schüler:innen genau den Ausbildungsplatz finden, der zu ihren individuellen Stärken und Interessen passt.\n\nZudem haben wir über 500 Kurzvideos produziert, in denen ehemalige Azubis und Influencer:innen, die die jeweilige Ausbildung selbst gemacht haben, realistische Einblicke in den Ausbildungsalltag geben. Darüber hinaus erstellen wir auch Videos im TikTok-Style für unsere Kunden und haben als Marktführer in diesem Bereich bereits in vielen Branchen – von Großkonzernen bis zum Mittelstand –  Erfolge feiern können.\n\nUm auch die Unternehmensperspektive einzubeziehen, haben wir 30 Personaler in unsere Produktentwicklung integriert. So haben wir einen Prozess zur Vorqualifizierung von Bewerber:innen entwickelt, der garantiert, dass nur passende Talente die Stelle erreichen. Das spart den Unternehmen nicht nur Zeit, sondern auch den Aufwand, Absagen an ungeeignete Kandidat:innen zu verschicken.

The biggest added value for restaurateurs is that they don't have to offer the deals at any time of the day, but can set them individually adjusted to the usual occupancy.\nSo if the restaurant is completely full on a saturday evening, which is usually the case, NeoTaste users don't even have the option of booking a deal for that period and choose a time when experience shows that fewer guests are welcomed. NeoTaste users have a culinary overview of their city, as well as many cool deals, such as 2for1 main course, a free appetizer and much more!\n\nBut that's just the beginning.
