The whole chain was then used in our contribution for the different European Union and the German government funded projects as well as our contributions for the joint work with different industry partners. Extensive study of the effect of using the different waveforms on performance in the context of ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) applications with a special focus on factory automation scenarios in the German funded project KOI (coordinated industrial communication). Followed the 3GPP standardisation discussions regarding new radio (NR) or commonly known 5G with focus on the waveforms and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) topics. Implemented several of the NOMA schemes proposed in 3GPP with focus on the massive machine type communication (mMTC) use case. Working on the inclusion of the implemented schemes to produce standardisation relevant contributions in the recently started NOMA study item. Hardware demo for the coexistence of mixed numerology waveforms for the European project FANTASTIC5G (flexible air interface for scalable service delivery within wireless communication networks of the 5th Generation).

Implemented several Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) reduction schemes from the literature of CP-OFDM and tested the performance of both waveforms using them. Implemented a new PAPR reduction scheme adapted for optimized PAPR reduction for FBMC signals. Implemented a new PAPR reduction scheme (two-stage PAPR reduction) that works on any waveform.

Creation of software and hardware specifically for a PowerPac and a compressed air system. *Two-way maneuvering vehicle: Vehicle that can be moved both on road and on rail. Main application: shunting of wagons or train sets. Central research question: The bachelor thesis dealt with the further development of a test procedure for testing different add-on modules (compressed air system and PowerPac) of a road-rail vehicle. In order to be able to test the add-on modules, a test device had to be designed and manufactured. A multi-function display is connected to the test device, with the aid of which the tester is guided graphically through the test sequence. The individual components communicate via CAN. The test sequence was developed in close cooperation with the production department.

I have designed antennas such as GSM band antenna for ambient energy harvesting, 24 GHz transparent screen-printed antenna, 77 GHz on-chip antenna for a single-chip radar application, 77 GHz beam switching antenna array for blind person guidance sensor, and 28 THz antenna for waste heat harvesting. Also, I have fabricated antennas and RF circuits using both conventional PCB milling and additive manufacturing using 2D and 3D printers. Moreover, I tested devices using VNAs, anechoic chambers, signal generators, spectrum analyzers, and other RF testing equipment to validate the results obtained from the simulations. I have published and co-authored four journal papers and six conference papers on these topics. During this period I also co-supervised four undergraduate students during there internship and gave CST training to our graduate students and interns."",""endDate"":""07/2019"",""company"":""KAUST"",""location"":""Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"",""position"":""Research Assistant"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""08/2015""}],""location"":""Munich, Germany"",""headline"":""Skilled RF/Microwave antennas engineer with extensive experience in antenna designing, prototyping, and testing at megahertz, giga ..."",""languageSkills"":{""English"":""Fluent"",""Russian"":""Fluent"",""Turkmen"":""Native/Bilingual"",""German"":""Fluent"",""Turkish"":""Native/Bilingual""}}",candidateRemoved,,undefined lm
