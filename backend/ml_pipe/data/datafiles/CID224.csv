Gut 40 Korrespondenten und mehrere Dutzend vor Ort angesiedelte Autoren beobachten das deutsche und internationale Geschehen. Sie berichten aus den deutschen Großstädten, aus den wichtigsten Zentren Europas und von allen Kontinenten. Die Autoren und Autorinnen der SZ wurden vielfach mit nationalen und internationalen Journalistenpreisen ausgezeichnet, etwa mit dem Egon-Erwin-Kisch-Preis oder mit dem Theodor-Wolff-Preis. Für die Recherche zu den Panama Papers, die die SZ gemeinsam mit dem International Council of Investigative Journalist (ICIJ) anstellte, erhielten unsere Reporter im Jahr 2017 den Pulitzer-Preis, den renommiertesten Journalistenpreis der Welt.  \n\nDie SZ zeichnet sich durch meinungsfreudigen und unabhängigen Journalismus aus. Sie legt Wert auf kritische Redakteure und kritische Leser.  Als meinungsbildendes Medium mit lokaler und regionaler Verankerung sind ihr die Prinzipien Liberalität, Toleranz und redaktionelle Unabhängigkeit besonders wichtig.\n\nDies hat eine lange Tradition: Schließlich war es die Süddeutsche Zeitung, der die US-Militärregierung im Oktober 1945 die Lizenz Nummer 1 für die erste Zeitung in Bayern nach Kriegsende gab. Noch am gleichen Abend erschien die erste Ausgabe.

Our 34,000 employees help connect our customers to the very best entertainment, sports, news, arts and to our own local, original content. Following the success of Sky originals like Chernobyl, we plan to double our investment in original content by 2024. \nWe’re also developing a new TV and movie studio, Sky Studios Elstree, which is expected to lead to the creation of over 2,000 new jobs and generate an additional £3 billion of production investment in UK creative sector in the first five years alone. \nOur technology allows Sky customers to watch what they want, when they want, how they want and connects millions of people to content they love. And our online streaming service, Sky Ticket, brings viewers all the enjoyment of Sky with the flexibility of a contract-free service. \nWe also believe that a company of our scale has a responsibility that goes beyond our business, and into the community. We recently announced a series of commitments to help tackle racial injustice and improve diversity and inclusion. To ensure the commitments are delivered, Sky will invest £10million per year across its markets for each of the next three years. We’re committed to being Europe’s first net zero carbon entertainment company by 2030 – two decades before we have to – and we’re an inclusive employer recognised by The Times and Stonewall for our commitment to diversity. \n\nImpressum: https://www.sky.de/impressum \nDatenschutz: https://www.sky.de/datenschutz"",""logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQGaNcCjL1Sygw/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1630556580042/sky_deutschland_gmbh__co_kg_logo?e=1747872000&v=beta&t=51jzPJur9sNiMwx4byJM0V79D9qG2FKNEe97CN9HbG8"",""industry"":[""Broadcast Media Production and Distribution""],""id"":""385867""},""description"":"""",""company"":""Sky Deutschland GmbH"",""location"":""Unterföhring, Bayern, Deutschland · Hybrid"",""position"":""Junior Sales Manager"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/07/2024""},{""duration"":""01/04/2019 - 01/05/2024"",""endDate"":""01/05/2024"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":""Abteilung Gesamtbetriebsrat (GBR)"",""company"":""Siemens"",""location"":""München, Bayern, Deutschland · On-site"",""position"":""Werkstudentin"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/04/2019""},{""duration"":""01/03/2015 - 01/07/2015"",""endDate"":""01/07/2015"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":""Pflichtpraktikum im Rahmen meiner schulischen Ausbildung an der FOS:\n- Unterstützung in den Abteilungen: Bürgerbüro, Tourismus Veranstaltungen, Öffentlichkeitsarbeit, Finanzverwaltung, Bildung Familie Jugend & Sport"",""company"":""Stadt Fürstenfeldbruck Rathaus"",""location"":""Fürstenfeldbruck, Bayern, Deutschland · On-site"",""position"":""Praktikantin"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/03/2015""},{""duration"":""01/10/2014 - 01/02/2015"",""endDate"":""01/02/2015"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":""Pflichtpraktikum im Rahmen meiner schulischen Ausbildung an der FOS:\n-Anlegung und Verwaltung von Mandaten Dokumenten\n-Finanzbuchführung von Belegen und Rechnungen"",""company"":""Scanlan & Partner Steuerberatung Wirtschaftsprüfung mbB"",""location"":""München, Bayern, Deutschland · On-site"",""position"":""Praktikantin"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/10/2014""}],""location"":""Alling, Bavaria, Germany"",""certifications"":[],""headline"":""Business Administrator B.A."",""languageSkills"":{""Englisch"":""Professional working proficiency""}}",backlog,,

But while our sole technology may be German, our soul is undeniably British. \n\nBritish shoe-makers, R Griggs and Co, bought the rights to that air-cushioned sole technology. R Griggs & Co anglicised the name to “Dr. Martens”, designed an outsole and boot for British workers and the 1460 boot was born. \n\nDr. Martens footwear was designed to look new with its modern air-cushion comfort so R Griggs & Co added the iconic yellow stitch, the grooves, the two tone side sole and the black and yellow heel loop. These new boots were sold to workmen. \n\nBut fate intervened. Dr. Martens may have been made for industry but, as it turns out, they were destined for the stage. Subverted early on by subcultures, they paved the way for a new kind of rebellious self-expression. From the punks of 70s London to the grungers of 90s Seattle, Dr. Martens boots have always stood with those who dare to be different. Subcultures may fade out and evolve but our alternative spirit is a constant. \n\nAnd as for what the future holds? \n\nWe have offices in London, Northampton, Paris, Düsseldorf, Portland, across Asia and an ever-expanding global retail portfolio. We have the respect of big-name fashion giants – think Supreme and Yohji Yamamoto – enabling us to engage in exciting partnerships season after season. \n\nWe want to mean something to everyone who laces up our boots: from the first-timers to the Docs boots veterans. \n\n\nDo you have what it takes to help us?

Orcan Energy's products tap into the enormous global waste heat potential and enable customers to save CO2 emissions and costs at the same time. Orcan Energy unlocks the energy potential of unused heat sources based on second-generation Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology. By massively downsizing the established technology and developing a modular solution, Orcan Energy is turning small and medium-sized waste heat sources, as well as lower temperatures into economically viable options for the first time. As a result, the modules can be installed directly wherever excess heat is generated, for example in industrial processes, in engines, on ships or even in geothermal plants. Orcan Energy's solutions are already helping companies in the cement, oil and gas, power generation, and marine sectors to achieve their sustainability goals, reduce costs and comply with future regulations. Thanks to flexible financing models, companies can save cash-flow-positive electricity or fuel costs with waste heat power generation from day one. Orcan Energy has already marketed more than 600 modules with over 7 million operating hours internationally.
