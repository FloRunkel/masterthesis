It’s the most intuitive early childhood platform out there with an unrivaled team dedicated to our customers' success - and changing the way early childhood is perceived.  Plus, with the backing of the largest investment into early childhood software in European history, we are here to stay.  \nOur platform lets families and educators help each other out, automates the boring stuff, and ultimately gives everyone a richer understanding of the children they nurture together.\nHow do we do it?\nWe improve a child’s learning journey by making it easier for nurturing adults to actively participate, share vital information, and grow closer.  We help providers work smarter, making operators more efficient with their money and time,  giving educators time back to spend on what matters.  We spread knowledge about child development to educators and families.  And we build our team by hiring people who are as passionate about making little ones a big deal as we are.\nTo join our team, head over here https://famly.recruitee.com/\nOr to book your free demo today, head over here https://famly.co/demo\nA good early childhood lasts a lifetime, so come and help us make sure the world gets more of them."",""logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQFxoZ0qA8-Jkw/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1669018601973/famly_logo?e=1747872000&v=beta&t=uyfqif3t8UEe21qZlQlSxP2lvQGRYS2ApzYQwVqkCYw"",""industry"":[""Software Development""],""id"":""3294390""},""description"":"""",""company"":""Famly"",""location"":""Berlin, Germany"",""position"":""Sales Development Representative"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/09/2024""},{""duration"":""01/01/2022 - 01/07/2024"",""endDate"":""01/07/2024"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":"""",""company"":""Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH"",""location"":""Berlin, Germany"",""position"":""Pädagogische Assistenz"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/01/2022""},{""duration"":""01/02/2018 - 01/05/2018"",""endDate"":""01/05/2018"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":"""",""company"":""International Rescue Committee"",""location"":""On-site"",""position"":""Student Intern"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/02/2018""},{""duration"":""01/04/2015 - 01/05/2015"",""endDate"":""01/05/2015"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":"""",""company"":""AMBEG Dr. J.

For all the things you want to get. For all the ways you want to earn. Across the entire world. In real time. At the incredible speed of now.\n\nThe idea for Uber was born on a snowy night in Paris in 2008, and ever since then our DNA of reimagination and reinvention carries on. We’ve grown into a global platform powering flexible earnings and the movement of people and things in ever expanding ways. We’ve gone from connecting rides on 4 wheels to 2 wheels to 18-wheel freight deliveries. From takeout meals to daily essentials to prescription drugs to just about anything you need at any time and earning your way. From drivers with background checks to real-time verification, safety is a top priority every single day.

The go-getters. The kind of people who are relentless about our mission to help people go anywhere and get anything and earn their way. Movement is what we power. It’s our lifeblood. It runs through our veins. It’s what gets us out of bed each morning. It pushes us to constantly reimagine how we can move better. For you. For all the places you want to go. For all the things you want to get. For all the ways you want to earn. Across the entire world. In real time. At the incredible speed of now.\n\nThe idea for Uber was born on a snowy night in Paris in 2008, and ever since then our DNA of reimagination and reinvention carries on. We’ve grown into a global platform powering flexible earnings and the movement of people and things in ever expanding ways. We’ve gone from connecting rides on 4 wheels to 2 wheels to 18-wheel freight deliveries. From takeout meals to daily essentials to prescription drugs to just about anything you need at any time and earning your way. From drivers with background checks to real-time verification, safety is a top priority every single day. At Uber, the pursuit of reimagination is never finished, never stops, and is always just beginning."",""logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQFiYnR1Mbtxdg/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1630552741617/uber_com_logo?e=1748476800&v=beta&t=dDs-hHagmvS6nIlFml--hl-cjZuUG9zX5NSU5NATouY"",""industry"":[""Internet Marketplace Platforms""],""id"":""1815218""},""description"":"""",""company"":""Uber"",""location"":""Berlin, Deutschland"",""position"":""Inside Sales Representative"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/02/2025""},{""duration"":""01/10/2024 - 01/02/2025"",""endDate"":""01/02/2025"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":""• Operational - SaaS (Mid-Market) Sales\n\n• Building up outbound sales and strategies with the sales department\n\n• Generated pipeline by B2B outbound prospecting/sales for all regions across the globe with focus on small to medium enterprises specifically in the Hospitality- , Facility- , Production- , Retail- , Sports- Industries\n\n• Generated pipeline by B2B inbound lead qualification\n\n"",""company"":""Lumiform"",""location"":""Berlin, Deutschland"",""position"":""Sales Development Representative"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/10/2024""},{""duration"":""01/05/2024 - 01/09/2024"",""endDate"":""01/09/2024"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":""• WhatsApp Marketing - SaaS (Enterprise) Sales\n\n• Primarily generated pipeline by B2B outbound prospecting/sales for the DACH (and EMEA) market with focus on medium and large enterprises specifically in the Consumer Electronic- , Health & Supplements- , Beauty- , Sports- , Fitness- , Food & Beverage- Industries , etc.\n\n• Generated pipeline by B2B inbound lead qualification\n\n• Biggest SQL's: Puma, Woom Bikes, Dermalogica, Yfood, Air Up, L'Oreal, Tonies, etc.\n\n"",""company"":""charles"",""location"":""Berlin, Deutschland"",""position"":""Business Development Representative"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/05/2024""}],""location"":""Berlin, Berlin, Germany"",""certifications"":[],""headline"":""Helping restaurants thrive @ UberEats"",""languageSkills"":{""Deutsch"":""Native or bilingual proficiency"",""Latein"":""Elementary proficiency"",""Englisch"":""Full professional proficiency"",""Spanisch"":""Elementary proficiency""}}",replySent,interested,2024-12-19T09:29:32.426Z lm

It focusses mainly on the delivery of melatonin, vitamin c and zinc capsules. \n\nImportant note - I did not work full time over the two years with GK. Rather,  I worked occasionally with the team throughout this time period. \n\nI was hired to develop a marketing strategy (mainly for social media & digital marketing) and writing captivating copy through several channels such as website, social media, e-mail, flyers and more.  Furthermore, I could help the founder Mohamed Bouaissa to scale up the business model by connecting him with my friend Alex (founder from ADCOLLECTIVE), an experienced & highly valuable performance marketer, who developed the website & ensured the practical implementation of the ad campaign strategy. \n\nAlex became THE Head of digital marketing & was one of the main reasons why scaling GK became a no-brainer. \n\nMohamed did a great job in creating a team full of creative talent and delivering on the brand promise. In corporation with Alex and Gündüz, the Head of Design at Goldenes Kleeblatt, we were able to design great UI, UX and set the tone of the brand through videos, images & text. \n\nIn the final phase of my work I created an irresistible offer for naturopaths to support the development of GK’s B2B segment. \n\nAll in all, I contributed to improving the sleeping habits of more than 1000 customers and had a lot of fun during the process with the team. \n\nI appreciate the offer from Mohamed and his partner to own the development of the B2B segment. However, for the moment (April 2022) I’m considering working in management consulting or the tech industry. Still, I do think about developing GK’s blog in the future - I’ll edit this section once I have started writing blog articles again.

Make sure that whenever you got the chance to visit this beautiful place, you don't hesitate. Plan your trip, think about the possible impact it may have on your life and go for it. You won't regret it. Stepping out of your comfort zone, meeting new people and getting to know a different culture will only enhance your wisdom, life quality and overall performance at work - it is truly a great investment. Especially when you do it while you're cute 19 years old, like I was at my arrival in Sydney. \n\nFurther, I am really thankful to the Business School of Economics and Law Berlin, which not only enabled me to study one semester abroad and do an internship at an amazing educational institution such as Social Media College, but more importantly - gain a life experience I won't forget. \n\nIt was an interesting internship within the marketing function (after football one of my biggest passions), in which I could finally use the skills I've gained over the last 3 years through visiting university and inhaling all the secret sales & marketing knowledge from books. \n\nThe SMC Team was great, the working atmosphere amazing and with Jonathon Tanner (CEO & Co Founder) I found a mentor, who was patient with the new intern, had trust in me and identified quickly my potentials. \n\nI was responsible for the Instagram Content Strategy & Community Management. Even though it was an unpaid role, it was worth investing my time and getting a first step into digital marketing. Social Media Marketing is cool, but I think that Digital Marketing is the real deal. Jon gave me the advice to go deeper into digital. As a former consultant, he taught me how to think strategically and truly opened my mind.

My older brothers founded a successful car rental agency here in Berlin that has grown over the last couple of years. I already got involved in 2014 (16 years old), where I've worked on simple tasks such as writing invoices and cleaning cars.\n\nDuring this internship I had the chance to have a look into several business functions such as accounting, marketing and operations. I had no big impact here, however I am very thankful for the privilege of being the younger brother that can learn from the successes & failures of his older ones. \n\nThey have taught me respect, humbleness & social behaviour. I do not think that I could have learned so much in a short amount of time, if I hadn't the chance to be so deeply involved in the growth of a startup from a young age. \n\nI could see how important it is to treat customers well so they come to rent from our agency at a consistent basis. Also, if you´re just your true authentic self, you'll be much more appreciated than if you're trying to be somebody else. Furthermore - planning is good, calculated action is better. \n\nMy older brother Anis, whom I respect a lot for his personal achievements, has always taught me to not focus too much on theory. Rather, sometimes you need to take bold risks so you can achieve your goals as an entrepreneur. And if you fail, well, then it is a lesson that you carry with you. Keep going.\n\nFrom my brother Imad I could learn the obsession to detail and its effects on customer satisfaction. He always made sure that the office & cars are clean. Of course, clients recognize that and respect the effort for delivering that service by revisiting Aniso & spreading word of mouth. \n\nAll in all I took with me that whatever I do - as long as I do it with passion & the ability to deliver measurable improvements, I can call it a day. \n\nCheers."",""company"":""Aniso Rent A Car"",""location"":""Berlin, Deutschland"",""position"":""Business Administrator"",""type"":""fullTime"",""startDate"":""01/06/2017""},{""duration"":""01/02/2013 - 01/02/2013"",""endDate"":""01/02/2013"",""companyInformation"":{},""description"":""I had my first internship in Berlin (two weeks) at PCCOM, a company which is helping consumers solving problems of hard- and software. \n\nIt was definitely a great experience since I could gain one of my first insights into the IT & management department.

In a high-speed digital world, third parties - like online travel agencies - have hijacked those direct interactions that used to go on between hotels and guests. Only thing is, these third parties never meet the guest face-to-face, meaning that customer experience suffers. Hotels, on the other hand, know their guests personally. They get to know how someone likes their coffee, what sports they're into, which spa treatments they enjoy, and how often they go hiking.\n\nSmart Host lets hotels use this knowledge in a systematic way. The hotel can re-establish direct interactions, the guest gets a better customer experience, and everyone wins. This process happens completely automatically and in the background. Smart Host uses the most advanced methods of data segmentation, machine learning, artificial intelligence and automatic communication systems. The result is an improved customer experience and communication, which turns into more direct bookings and increased profitability.  \n\nOur team is diverse, international and highly motivated.
